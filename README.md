# refactorAnalyasis
## The Purpose

We are doing this for a friend name Steve who is starting to give stock advice for his career in finance after graduating. His first client was his parents and they wanted to invest in some green stocks. We refactor the workbook to see if it was faster.

## The Results

### Runtime

The runtime for the refactored code ran much quicker than the original workbook. As you can see in the image here:

As you can see, it ran almost 8 times faster with the refactor.
